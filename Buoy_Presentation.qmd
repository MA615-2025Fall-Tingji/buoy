## NOAA Buoy Data Website

The **National Data Buoy Center (NDBC)** provides real-time and historical buoy data for oceans and lakes, including:

- Wave height and period  
- Wind speed and direction  
- Air and water temperature  
- Barometric pressure  

Explore the website here: [NOAA NDBC Buoy Data](https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/)
